# CritterCodes Web Development SOP

Welcome to the CritterCodes Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) repository! This repository contains a set of guidelines and best practices for building, organizing, and deploying web applications using CritterCodes standards.

## Overview

The SOP covers the complete web application lifecycle, focusing on a consistent, structured approach to developing with **JavaScript** frameworks and libraries, including **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **React.js**, and **Docker**. The repository also includes guidelines for using custom CritterCodes packages such as **CritterCodes@Express-Cli** and **CritterCodes@React-Cli**.

## Contents

### 1. **Project Setup**
   - [Environment Setup](./setup/environment.md): Guidelines for setting up the Node.js and React environment.
   - [Project Initialization](./setup/initialization.md): Instructions for initializing projects using CritterCodes@Express-Cli and CritterCodes@React-Cli for streamlined setup.

### 2. **Backend Development (Express Server)**
   - [Express Server Structure](./backend/express_structure.md): Recommended file structure, naming conventions, and architectural patterns for Express.
   - [File Naming Best Practices](./backend/file_naming.md): Naming conventions and folder organization for consistency in backend code.
   - [Database Integration](./backend/database_integration.md): Best practices for integrating MongoDB securely.
   - [API Development Guidelines](./backend/api_guidelines.md): Standards for developing RESTful APIs, including error handling, response structures, and CritterCodes-specific standards.

### 3. **Frontend Development (React App)**
   - [React Project Structure](./frontend/react_structure.md): File structure, naming conventions, and organizational patterns using CritterCodes@React-Cli.
   - [File Naming Best Practices](./frontend/file_naming.md): Naming conventions to maintain clarity and consistency in frontend files.
   - [State Management](./frontend/state_management.md): Patterns and practices for managing state efficiently.
   - [Styling and Theming](./frontend/styling.md): Standards for styling, supporting dark/light themes, and utilizing CSS best practices.

### 4. **Development Workflow**
   - [Git Workflow](./workflow/git_workflow.md): A guide for maintaining clean, consistent commit history and branch management.
   - [Coding Standards](./workflow/coding_standards.md): JavaScript, React, and Node.js coding standards, including CritterCodes-specific style rules.
   - [Code Review Process](./workflow/code_review.md): Guidelines for reviewing and approving code for quality and consistency.

### 5. **Deployment**
   - [Docker Setup and Configuration](./deployment/docker_setup.md): Best practices for Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations for development and production.
   - [Deployment to Development Server](./deployment/dev_server.md): Steps for deploying to a staging or development environment.
   - [Production Deployment](./deployment/prod_deployment.md): Secure deployment practices, including environment configuration for production servers.
